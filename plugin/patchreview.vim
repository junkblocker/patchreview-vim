" ===========================================================================
" This plugin allows single or multiple, patch or diff based code reviews to
" be easily done in VIM. VIM has :diffpatch command to do single file reviews
" but a) can not handle patch files containing multiple patches or b) do
" automated diff generation for various version control systems. This plugin
" attempts to provide those functionalities. It opens each changed / added or
" removed file diff in new tabs.
"
" Requirements:
"
"   1) VIM 7.0 or higher built with +diff option.
"
"   2) A gnu compatible patch command installed. This is the standard patch
"      command on Linux, Mac OS X, *BSD, Cygwin or /usr/bin/gpatch on newer
"      Solaris.
"
" Usage:
"
"  Please see :help patchreview, :help diffreview or :help reversepatchreview
"  for details.
